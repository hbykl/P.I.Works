# Question 6

## Please estimate the number of base stations in Istanbul by explaining how you estimated this number.
There are 39 districts and nearly 900 neighborhoods in Istanbul. Since each district has a different population and area, it's challenging to provide an exact number, but on average, if there were 45-50 base stations in each neighborhood, there could be around 40,000-50,000 base stations in the city.
