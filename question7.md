# Question 7

## If you were a product manager at WhatsApp, which two new features would you introduce? If you need to prioritize one of them since it is not allowed to develop features in parallel, based on which factors do you make your prioritization?
 
If I were a product manager at WhatsApp, I would propose two new features:
- **Rename Contact When Sharing:**This feature would allow users to edit a contact's name when sharing it with someone else. This could be particularly important for users who want to protect their personal information. By offering privacy and flexibility, this feature would enable users to have a more controlled sharing experience.
- **Anonymous Closed Polling and Voting:** This feature would enable anonymous participation in group polls, where votes remain confidential and the results are visible only to certain group admins. It would allow for more honest and unbiased feedback within groups.

I would prioritize the Rename Contact When Sharing feature. My decision is based on the importance of ensuring privacy and security. This feature allows users to share their personal information in a more controlled manner, which increases trust in the platform. Additionally, this feature is innovative and could make WhatsApp more appealing. It addresses the growing demand for privacy and offers an easy and quick solution, leading to a direct improvement in user experience.
